I chose to do a PERN stack involving tournament scheduling for my slow-pitch softball team. We currently use Facebook group messaging and there is constant panic the night before a tournament to see who will be playing that weekend. This is app is meant to help our players future plan their lives and what tournaments they would like to play.

====Technical Features====

I tried to join tables with Postgres but it didn't make sense to do that after a couple days. I decided to learn and implement create-react-app but backed off from that because I was not comfortable with the deployment aspect. I kept the components from the CRA but it got pretty confusing remembering what pointed to what. So if anyone wants to know how not to do CRA, i'll give you my number. I used bulma as the framework.

Further, I would like to set the tournaments in chronological order going forward. I tried to implement socket.io but I was lost and it was breaking everything. I'll need to get with the people who have had real time messaging success.
